            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">At the primary and secondary level, India has a large private school
                system complementing the government run schools,
                with 29% of students receiving private education in the 6 to 14 age group.[21] Certain post-secondary
                technical schools
                are also private. The private education market in India had a revenue of US$450 million in 2008, but is
                projected to be
                a US$40 billion market.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">In 1835, the English Education Act was passed by the British in India.
                This act made English formal medium of education
                in all schools and colleges. This act neglected both indigenous schools and mass education, as only the
                small section of
                upper-class Indians were educated to become the connecting link between the government and the
                masses.[49] This act is
                today popularly known as Macaulayism.</p>
